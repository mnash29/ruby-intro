# Say hello-world in different ways
# Simple put string
# Using a variable
# Using a method

puts "Working with Ruby"
# Calls 'puts' method which prints the string and returns 'nil'

p "Working with Ruby"
# Sends string to 'p' method and returns the same argument string instead 
# of 'nil'

# print "Working with Ruby" works the same as 'p' but without newline
